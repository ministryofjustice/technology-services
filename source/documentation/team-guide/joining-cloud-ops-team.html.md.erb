Welcome to the team! Below is some information that you might find useful.

## General information

- Our standups are currently at 10.00am every morning
- We have our sprint ceremonies every fortnight on a Tuesday afternoon
- We plan our sprints through [Jira](https://dsdmoj.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=432&projectKey=PTTP&selectedIssue=PTTP-2970&quickFilter=1066)

### Team

- our alliance
- our roadmap
- our vision
- who's in the team

### Your first sprint ceremonies

When you join the team, we want you to feel welcome and included. With your input, we'll collectively update our [team alliance], and you'll be able to meet the team if you haven't done so already.

## Team tools

### Microsoft Teams, Slack, Google Meet!

Our main chat platform is Slack.

We use Microsoft Teams and Google Meet for team calls, and use Slack for direct calls.


### Slack channels to join

We have three main Slack channels.

#### #mojo-cloud-ops

The [#mojo-cloud-ops](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C01J2L0SC0P) channel is our team channel where we have team discussions about anything ranging from:

- in-depth technical issues
- our plans for the day
- to request someone else from the team's help
- when we're away for lunch
- general musings

If you can't make standup, post your standup update here.

#### #ask-cloud-ops

The [#ask-cloud-ops](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C026AFE617T) channel is for anyone who isn't in the team to:

- ask questions about the services we run
- get advice from the team

#### #cloud-ops-notifications

The [#mojo-cloud-ops-notifications](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C023F6BDH2S) channel is where we:

- direct notifications from GitHub, such as pull requests or issues

It's a noisy channel, so it's up to you whether to join it.

### GitHub teams to join (optional)

To add or close issues in our GitHub Project, you need to join the [MOJ-Official-Techops](https://github.com/orgs/ministryofjustice/teams/moj-official-techops) team on GitHub.

The team memberships are [defined in code](). If you're comfortable doing so, please add your GitHub username there.

If you're not comfortable updating Terraform files, send a message in the [#mojo-cloud-ops](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C01J2L0SC0P) channel and someone in the team will help you.

### Learning and development

- [Lean Tech Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/r7ntXcC6/learn-tech) for questions that you have about our Friday learning sessions

## Further information

We're currently building our documentation to cover core concepts and general practices within the team.

It's worth having a read through the user guide and concepts pages.

There is a varying level of technical detail across the documentation, so if you have any questions or are interested in something in particular, feel free to reach out in [#cloud-ops](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C01J2L0SC0P).
