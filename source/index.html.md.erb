### Cloud Platform

[Cloud Platform](https://user-guide.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/) manages the infrastructure that your application runs on and provides tooling for teams to deploy and manage their applications on that infrastructure. By default, you must use the Cloud Platform unless you’re advised otherwise by a member of the [Hosting](https://peoplefinder.service.gov.uk/teams/hosting) team.
